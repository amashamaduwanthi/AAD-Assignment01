Serializable And Deserializable

Introduction

Complex data structures, such as objects, can be transformed into a format that is
readily saved and conveyed by using the procedures of serialization and
deserialization. These formats can then be rebuilt into their original form. Java defines
serialization as the process of transforming an object into a byte stream and
deserialization as the opposite process, in which the original object is recreated using
the byte stream.

Advantages of Serializable and Deserializable

The primary benefits of serialization and deserialization include:
01.Persistence: Objects can be saved to files or databases and later restored.
02.Communication: Serialized objects can be sent over a network between 03.
different components of a distributed system.
03.
Caching: Serialized objects can be cached to improve performance by
avoiding repeated object creation.
04.
Deep Copy: Serialization can be used to create a deep copy of an object.

Mechanism

The mechanism of serialization and deserialization in Java involves the Serializable
interface and the ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes.
01.
Serialization:
An object is converted into a byte stream using the ObjectOutputStream class.
The object must implement the Serializable interface.
Fields marked as transient are not serialized.
02.
Deserialization:
The byte stream is converted back into an object using the ObjectInputStream
class.The deserialization process reconstructs the object, including its non-transient
fields.

Code Explain

A user's name, age, and password are among the attributes that the User class is
intended to represent. To make serialization possible, it implements the Serializable
interface. By not storing sensitive data, the password field is designated as transitory,
improving security by preventing serialization. For logging and debugging reasons,
the toString() function offers a textual representation of the User object.
